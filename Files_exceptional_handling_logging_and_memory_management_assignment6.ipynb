        "# Q2. What is exception handling in Python?\n",
        "# Exception handling in Python is a mechanism that allows a program to handle runtime errors using try, except, and finally blocks.\n",
        "\n",
        "# Q3. What is the purpose of the finally block in exception handling?\n",
        "# The finally block ensures that cleanup code (such as closing files) executes regardless of whether an exception occurs.\n",

        "# Q5. What is the significance of the __del__ method in Python?\n",

        "# Q6. What is the difference between import and from ... import in Python?\n",
